Make a new folder "c:/eric-the-red"

Every thing to do with "EricTheRed" must be in this directory because it is hard coded into the software.
This will be:
- EricTheRedConfig.exe (not required on the remote site but useful when you are there)
- EricTheRedWorker.exe (only required at the remote site)
- eric-the-red.ini (When you upload a new eric-the-red.ini, this is where you put it,
                    EricTheRedConfig.exe writes it's updated copies here as well)
- wget.exe (Found in the supplied zip file)
- blat.exe (Found in the supplied zip file)

In the zip file all the executable files have been renamed to .ex_ to prevent ISP 
email antivirsus is faging them a virsus when you send an email and also many
antivirsus programmes will fag them the same way.

On both the remote and home computer all the files in the zip files must be put in
 c;/eric-the-red folder then the ex_files must then be renamed to exe.

Usage EricTheRedConfig.exe must be run and it will right eric-the-red.ini will be
written.   Eric-the-red.ini must then be copied to the remote site {c;/eric-the-red}.  A time schedule to run EricTheRedWorker.exe must be set up in windows
schedule taste of a frequency of your choice { once a day would be sufficient }
EricTheRedWorker.exe will check that the current IP of the remote site has or has not changed  and if it has changed you will be notified in email.   It will also
detect other faults with the IP returns by the checking websites and notified you
when this also happens by email, so that you can take corrective action, that involves you finding another website that will report your IP . EricTheRedConfig.exe will verify that the website you have chosen is actually 
reporting correctly and is insink with the two other website that you have chosen.
