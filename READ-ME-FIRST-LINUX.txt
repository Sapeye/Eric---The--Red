With root privileges in a consul window, type the following.

mkdir /anyone

chmod 777 /anyone

mkdir /anyone/eric-the-red

chmod 777 /anyone/eric-the-red

The new anyone directory is useful because any user has read + write privileges.
However the root will have to do the "chmod 777 /(new directory path)" as root owns the directory.

Every thing to do with "EricTheRed" must be in this directory because it is hard coded into the software.
This will be:
- EricTheRedConfig (not required on the remote site but useful when you are there)
- EricTheRedWorker (only required at the remote site)
- eric-the-red.ini (When you upload a new eric-the-red.ini, this is where you put it,
                    EricTheRedConfig writes it's updated copies here as well)

Dependencies. There are non, the software is stand alone.

Other requirements. wget and sendmail must be installed and will be in almost all Linux instillations.
Just double check that it is on yours and install if necessary.
Also make sure that "EricTheRedConfig" and "EricTheRedWorker" are checked off as executable or you will be up that infamous creek and no paddle.
